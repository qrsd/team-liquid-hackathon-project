# Team Liquid Hackathon

## Info
eSports based hackathon. 
We decided to create a discord bot that helps facilitate finding scrims for valorant.

What it does: 
A user will send a command into a discord channel, then if their command contains the right arguments and criteria as another user, those users will then be given each other's discord usernames and are able to message each other about scrims. Users type a command i.e '-LFS NAW today 5pm
